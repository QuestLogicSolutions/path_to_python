## today 9/14/2022 we will work on print statements, input, as well as mathematical equations

#Data Types
#String = either characters or words. Strings need " " around them
#Integers = whole numbers
#Floats or Doubles = fractional numbers such as longitude and latitude

# print("Hello World")
# print("My name is Alex")
# print("H")
#
# print("91422")
# print(24 + 6)
# print(234556655.56)
#
# first_name = "Alex"
# last_name = "Ngounou"
#
# x = 12
# y = 3
# space = " "
#
# print(x + y)
#
# #in the line below, the print statement will concatenate first_name and last_name
# print(first_name + space + last_name)
#
# print(first_name.upper())
# print(first_name.lower())
#
#
# print(x/y)
# print(x*y)
# print(x+y)
# print(x-y)


#Input
game_first_name = input("What is your first name? ")
game_last_name = input("What is your last name? ")
game_age = input("How old are you? ")

print("Your first name is " + game_first_name)
print("Your last name is " + game_last_name)
print("You are currently " + game_age + " years old!")
